# Style guide for AIPs

AIP stands for **API Improvement Proposal**, which is a design document
providing high-level, concise documentation for API development. The goal is
for these documents to serve as the source of truth for API-related
documentation at Google and the way API teams discuss and come to consensus on
API guidance.

AIPs are most useful when they are clear and concise, and cover a single topic
or inquiry well. In the same way that AIPs describe consistent patterns and
style for use in APIs, they also _follow_ consistent patterns and style.

## Guidance

AIPs **must** cover a single, discrete topic, and **should** fundamentally
answer the question, "What do I do?" AIPs **may** also cover what _not_ to do,
but **should not** _only_ cover anti-patterns.

While the length of AIPs will necessarily vary based on the complexity of the
question, most AIPs **should** be able to cover their content in roughly two
printed pages.

### File structure

AIPs **must** be written in Markdown, and **must** be named using their
four-digit number (example: `0008.md`). AIPs that serve a specific scope
**must** be in the subdirectory for that scope.

AIPs **must** have appropriate front matter.

```

Front matter for AIPs **must** include:

- The `aip` key:
  - `id`: Required. The ID for the given AIP, as an integer.
  - `state`: Required. The current state of the AIP, in all lower-case. The
    valid states are listed in [AIP-1][], and common states are `draft`,
    `reviewing`, and `approved`.
  - `created`: Required. The ISO-8601 date (`yyyy-mm-dd`) when the AIP was
    originally drafted, with no quotes.
  - `updated`: The ISO-8601 date (`yyyy-mm-dd`) when the AIP was last revised.
  - `scope`: The scope for the AIP. This **must** match the directory name for
    that scope. Required for AIPs with IDs >= 1000, prohibited otherwise.
- The `permalink` key (required): This **must** be set to
  `/{aip.scope}/{aip.id}`. If there is no scope, use `/{aip.id}` instead.
- The `redirect_from` key: This should include a list of any `/{aip.id}`
  permutations that a reader would be likely to enter, including:
  - `/{aip.id}` (for AIPs where the permalink includes the scope)
  - AIP IDs with zero-padding, for each level of zero-padding up to four digits
    (for example: `/08`, `/008`, `/0008`).

### Document structure

AIPs **must** begin with a top-level heading with the AIP's title (`# Title`).
The title should be a noun (not an imperative).

AIPs **should** then begin with an introduction (with no additional heading),
followed by a `## Guidance` heading. If necessary, the AIP **may** include any
of the following after the guidance, in the following order:

- Further reading
- Appendices
- Changelog

The guidance section **may** include subsections that elaborate further on
details. Subsections create an entry in the table of contents, and an anchor
for citations.

Below is an example AIP shell that uses each major section:

```md
# AIP title

The introductory text explains the background and reason why the AIP exists. It
lays out the basic question, but does not tell the reader what to do.

## Guidance

The "guidance" section helps the reader know what to do. A common format for
the guidance section is a high-level imperative, followed by an example,
followed by a bulleted list explaining the example.

### Subsection

Individual subsections can be cited individually, and further elaborate
details.

## Further reading

A bulleted list of (usually) other AIPs, in the following format:

- [AIP-1](./0001.md): AIP purpose and guidelines

## Appendix

An appendix is appropriate when a non-trivial side discussion is necessary. It
may explain historical reasons for the guidance, alternatives considered, or
other issues possibly of interest to the reader

## Changelog

A bulleted list of changes, in the following format:

- **2019-07-01**: Added a subsection clarifying XYZ.
```

AIPs **should** attempt to follow this overall format if possible, but AIPs
**may** deviate from it if necessary (in particular, if the AIP would be more
difficult to understand, even for a reader already accustomed to reading AIPs
in the usual format).

**Note:** Except for the title, AIPs **must** only use the second heading level
(`##`) and above. AIPs **should** only use the second and third heading levels
(`##`, `###`).

### Requirement keywords

AIPs **should** use the following requirement level keywords: "MUST", "MUST
NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", and "MAY", which are to be interpreted as
described in [RFC 2119][].

When using these terms in AIPs, they **must** be lower-case and **bold**. These
terms **should not** be used in other ways.

### Code examples

API design examples in AIPs **should** use [protocol buffers][]. Examples
**should** cover only enough syntax to explain the concept. When using RPCs in
examples, a `google.api.http` annotation **should** generally be included.

### Referencing AIPs

When AIPs reference other AIPs, they **must** use the format `AIP-XXX`, and
**must** link to the relevant AIP. AIP links **may** point to a particular
section of the AIP if appropriate.
