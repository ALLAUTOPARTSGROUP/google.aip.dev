# Singleton resources

APIs sometimes need to represent a resource where one and exactly one of the
resource always exists within any given parent. A common use case for this is
for a settings object.

## Guidance

An API **may** define _singleton resources_. Singleton resources always exist
by virtue of the existence of its parent, and there is always exactly one per
parent.

```proto
rpc GetSettings(GetSettingsRequest) returns (Settings) {
  option (google.api.http) = {
    get: "/v1/{name=users/*/settings}"
  };
}

rpc UpdateSettings(UpdateSettingsRequest) returns (Settings) {
  option (google.api.http) = {
    patch: "/v1/{settings.name=users/*/settings}"
  };
}
```

- Singleton resources have no user-provided or system-generated ID; their
  [resource name][aip-122] includes the name of their parent followed by one
  static-segment.
  - Example: `users/1234/settings`
- Singleton resources **must not** define the `Create`, `List`, or `Delete`
  standard methods. The singleton is implicitly created or deleted when its
  parent is created or deleted.
- Singleton resource **should** define the `Get` and `Update` methods, and
  **may** define custom methods as appropriate.
