# Standard methods: Get

In REST APIs, it is customary to make a `GET` request to a resource's URI (for
example, `/v1/shelves/{shelf}/books/{book}`) in order to retrieve that
resource.

[Resource-oriented design][] honors this pattern through the `Get` method.
These RPCs accept the URI representing that resource and return the resource.

## Guidance

APIs **should** generally provide a get method for resources unless it is not
valuable for users to do so. The purpose of the get method is to return data
from a single resource.

Get methods are specified using the following pattern:

```proto
rpc GetBook(GetBookRequest) returns (Book) {
  option (google.api.http) = {
    get: "/v1/{name=shelves/*/books/*}"
  };
}
```

- The RPC's name **must** begin with the word `Get`. The remainder of the RPC
  name **should** be the singular form of the resource's message name.
- The request message **must** match the RPC name, with a `-Request` suffix.
- The response message **must** be the resource itself. (There is no
  `GetBookResponse`.)
- The HTTP verb **must** be `GET`.
- The request message field receiving the resource name **should** map to the
  URL path.
  - This field **should** be called `name`.
  - The `name` field **should** be the only variable in the URI path. All
    remaining parameters **should** map to URI query parameters.
- There **must not** be a `body` key in the `google.api.http` annotation.

### Request message

Get methods implement a common request message pattern:

```proto
message GetBookRequest {
  // The name of the book to retrieve.
  // Format: shelves/{shelf}/books/{book}
  string name = 1;
}
```

- A `name` field **must** be included. It **should** be called `name`.
- The comment for the field **should** document the resource pattern.

### Getting unique resources from sub-collections

Sometimes, a resource within a sub-collection has an identifier that is unique
across parent collections. In this case, it may be useful to allow a Get RPC to
retrieve that resource without knowing which parent collection contains it. In
such cases, it is recommended to use a standard Get on the resource and specify
the wildcard collection ID `-` for all parent collections within which the
resource is unique:

    GET https://library.googleapis.com/v1/shelves/-/books/{book}

The resource name in the response to this call **must** use the canonical name
of the resource, with _actual_ parent collection identifiers (instead of `-`)
for each parent collection. For example, the request above returns a resource
with a name like `shelves/123/books/456`, _not_ `shelves/-/books/456`.
