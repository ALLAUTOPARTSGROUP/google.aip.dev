# GET for a single resource

In REST APIs, it is customary to make a `GET` request to a resource's URI (for
example, `/v1/publishers/{publisher}/books/{book}`) in order to retrieve that
resource.

Our APIs honor this pattern by allowing `GET` requests to be sent to the
resource URI, which return the resource itself.

## Guidance

APIs **should** generally provide a `GET` method for resources unless it is not
valuable for users to do so. The purpose of this method is to return data for a
single resource.

Single-resource `GET` methods are specified using the following pattern:

```yaml
paths:
  /publishers/{publisher_id}/books/{book_id}:
    get:
      operationId: getBook
      description: Get a single book.
      responses:
        200:
          description: OK
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                $ref: '#/components/schemas/Book'
```

- The `operationId` **must** begin with the word `get`. The remainder of the
  `operationId` **should** be the singular form of the resource type's name.
- The response content **must** be the resource itself. For example:
  `#/components/schemas/Book`
- The HTTP verb **must** be `GET`.
  - The request **must** be safe and **must not** have side effects.
- The URI **should** contain a variable for each individual ID in the resource
  hierarchy.
  - These fields **should** be named after the resource type with an `_id`
    suffix.
- There **must not** be a request body.
  - If a `GET` request contains a body, the body **must** be ignored, and
    **must not** cause an error.

### Errors

If the user does not have permission to access the resource, regardless of
whether or not it exists, the service **must** reply with an HTTP 404 error.
Permission **must** be checked prior to checking if the resource exists.

If the user does have proper permission, but the requested resource does not
exist, the service **must** reply with an HTTP 404 error.

## Changelog

- **2019-12-18**: Drafted up the IBM variant. :-)
- **2019-10-18**: Added guidance on annotations.
- **2019-08-12**: Added guidance for error cases.
- **2019-08-01**: Changed the examples from "shelves" to "publishers", to
  present a better example of resource ownership.
- **2019-05-29**: Added an explicit prohibition on arbitrary fields in standard
  methods.
