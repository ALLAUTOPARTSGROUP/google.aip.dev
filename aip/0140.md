# Field names

Naming fields in a way that is intuitive to users can often be one of the most
challenging aspects of designing an API. This is true for many reasons; often a
field name that seems entirely intuitive to the author can baffle a reader.

Additionally, users do not use only one API; they use many APIs together. When
the same company uses the same name to mean different things, or uses different
names to mean the same thing, that can often cause unnecessary confusion,
because it reduces users' cognitive leverage as they move from one API to
another.

APIs are easiest to understand when field names are simple, intuitive, and
consistent with one another.

## Guidance

Field names **should** be in correct American English.

Field definitions in protobuf files **must** use `snake_case` names. These
names are mapped to an appropriate naming convention in JSON and in generated
code.

Field names **should** clearly and precisely communicate the concept being
presented, and avoid overly general names that are ambiguous. That said, field
names **should** avoid including unnecessary words. In particular, avoid
including adjectives that always apply and add little cognitive value. For
example, a `proxy_settings` field might be as helpful as
`shared_proxy_settings` if there is no unshared variant.

### Consistency

APIs **should** endeavor to use the same name for the same concept and
different names for different concepts wherever possible. This includes names
across multiple APIs, in particular if those APIs are likely to be used
together.

### Repeated fields

Repeated fields **must** use the proper plural form, such as `books` or
`authors`.

### Prepositions

Field names **should not** include prepositions (such as "with", "for", "at",
"by"). For example:

- Prefer `error_reason` over `reason_for_error`.
- Prefer `author` over `written_by`.

It is easier for field names to match more often when following this
convention. Additionally, prepositions in field names sometimes also indicates
a design concern, such as an overly-restrictive field, or a sub-optimal data
type. This is particularly true regarding "with": a field named
`book_with_publisher` likely indicates that something should be designed
differently.

**Note:** The word "per" is an exception to this rule, particularly in two
cases. Often "per" is part of a unit (e.g. "miles per hour"). Additionally,
"per" is often appropriate in reporting scenarios (e.g. "nodes per instance" or
"failures per hour").

### Adjectives

For consistency, field names that contain both a noun and an adjective
**should** place the adjective before the noun. For example:

- Prefer `collected_items` over `items_collected`.
- Prefer `imported_objects` over `objects_imported`.

### Booleans

Boolean fields **should** omit the prefix "is". For example:

- Prefer `disabled` over `is_disabled`.
- Prefer `required` over `is_required`.

**Note:** Field names that would otherwise be [reserved words](#reserved-words)
are an exception to this rule. For example, prefer `is_new` over `new`.

### Reserved words

Field names **should** avoid using names that are likely to conflict with
keywords in common programming languages, such as `new`, `class`, `function`,
`import`, etc. Reserved keywords can cause hardship for developers using the
API in that language.
